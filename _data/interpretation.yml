    <p>A region with <strong>low density</strong> has few points and little overdraw. A region with <strong>low diversity</strong> has few classes. Regions with low density and diversity will have little to no movement or color flickering.</p>

    <p>A region with <strong>low density</strong> has few points and little overdraw. A region with <strong>high diversity</strong> has many classes (i.e. many colors). Regions with low density and high diversity have little to no movement but many different colors.</p>
